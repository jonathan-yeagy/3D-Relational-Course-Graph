# 3D Relational Course Graph

This class project is a 3D relational graph showing each student at Pennsylvania College of Technology and how they are
connected based on their majors, schools of discipline, and enrolled classes.

## Technologies Used

- HTML 5
- CSS 3
- JavaScript ES6
- jQuery 3.4.1
- 3D Force-Directed Graph 1.52.0
- PHP 7.3.6
- MySQL 5.6

## Getting Started

**Entrypoint:** index.html

> **Note:** This project requires access to a database that is property of Pennsylvania College of Technology.

## Context

This project was made in 2019 as a class assignment to demonstrate a competency in JavaScript by displaying JSON data
asynchronously.

Eventually, the school provided the class with database access allowing us to display the entire college's relational
data. This however, required pulling the data from a MySQL database and converting it into JSON so that the 3D
Force-Directed Graph would be able to interpret it.

I contributed to this project over the course of roughly 5 weeks.
